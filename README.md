## 🌸 Iris Flower Species Classification Using AI

A complete Machine Learning project that classifies Iris flowers into three different species using the Random Forest Classification algorithm. This project demonstrates the complete AI workflow, from data exploration to model deployment, and was developed as part of the DecodeLabs Artificial Intelligence Internship.

## 📖 Project Overview

Machine Learning has become an essential part of Artificial Intelligence by enabling computers to make intelligent decisions from data. This project applies Machine Learning techniques to classify Iris flowers into three different species using their physical characteristics.

The project follows a complete end-to-end Machine Learning pipeline, including:

* Loading and exploring the dataset
* Data preprocessing
*Data visualization
*Model training using Random Forest
*Performance evaluation
*Cross-validation
*Feature importance analysis
*Saving the trained model
*Predicting unseen flower species

The goal is to demonstrate a production-style machine learning workflow while maintaining clean, readable, and professional Python code.

## 🤖 Machine Learning Algorithm
Random Forest Classifier

Random Forest is an ensemble learning algorithm that builds multiple decision trees and combines their predictions to achieve high accuracy while reducing overfitting.

Why Random Forest?

✔ High Prediction Accuracy

✔ Handles Non-linear Data

✔ Less Overfitting

✔ Provides Feature Importance

✔ Fast and Reliable
